# substrate-sauce

The motivation behind this project is that the [kitchen/modules](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/kitchen/modules) for the recipes is becoming too crowded. At this point, I notice three different types of modules

1. basic examples for using specific substrate api features (like `double-map` or `generic-event`)
2. examples of best practices in the context of a minimal, yet expressive example
3. redundant pattern examples in the form of other use cases

I prefer to keep everything as flat as possible (for *developer experience*), but it is necessary to categorize the module samples in order to provide a more approachable view of samples for developers.

> Note that if some categorization is attempted, many links will need to be updated
