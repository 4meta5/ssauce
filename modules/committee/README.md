# vote

*features*
* hosts a custom origin, which is controlled not by 1p1v but by signal-weighted voting
* runtime instancing

**TODO** (immediate)
* look at most recent versions of all references:
    * `collective` `=>` should be able to support origins like `EnsureSupportAtLeast` in the `vote` module instances
    * `frame/membership`
    * `frame/scored-membership`
    * `frame/society`

* `+` `democracy` and `elections` (custom origin specifically)

* vote counting offchain (*feel free to rabbit hole into phragmen and write up a more in-depth explainer of the phragmen algorithm code*)
