# Vote

*(built alongside poll)*

for inspiration, see
* `pallet-society`
* `pallet-democracy`
* `pallet-elections-phragmen`
* `pallet-elections`
* `polkadot/crowdfund` (managing elections in child tries if there is a lot of associated data)

I'd like to implement a version (or instance) of `vote` called `vote-delegate` which allows for more expressive delegation of votes similar to phragmen but without its complexity.
